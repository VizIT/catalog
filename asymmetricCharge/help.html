    <h4>An Assymetric Electric Dipole And Its Field</h4>
    <p>
      Rotate and zoom in on the charges to see the structure of the field.
      Because the charges are no longer symmetric, the field lines are no
      longer closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoming out shows that at a large distances the field looks more and
     more like that from a point charge.
