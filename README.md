[Visualization Catalog](http://vizit.github.io/catalog/)
========================================================
A Collection Of Electric Field Visualizations
---------------------------------------------

The Visualization Catalog contains pre-built visualizations for the [efield library](http://vizit.github.io/efield/).
Visualizations include the electric field from point charges, line charges, planes and cylinders. Many examples
include Gaussian surfaces as well. Each visualization can be included in any web content with the short HTML
snippet from the catalog entry description. It is also possible to install and use the catalog locally. For
local use it is necessary to install the [efield library](http://vizit.github.io/efield/) in an accompanying
directory.
